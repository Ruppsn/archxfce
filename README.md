# ArcoLinuxD XFCE desktop with my own edits

TO-DO:

[] Update Software list to august2019

[] Update/Make a Theming script




## Vision of ArcoLinuxD

This github will not only install the desktop.
But we will install all my needed software.

Change the scripts to give it your personal touch.
Hashtag out the applications you do not want.

Copy/paste lines and add applications you do want.

And then run the scripts.
